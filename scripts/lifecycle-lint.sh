#   b  orphaned brief: a live docs/briefs/*-brief.md whose plan already sits in docs/archive/
#   c  an OPEN issue still referencing an ARCHIVED plan stem (completed work, open ticket);
#      backlog `idea` issues are exempt - parked ideas cite archived stems by design
#   d  a CLOSED issue referenced by a LIVE plan (local backend only: tracker.sh list exposes
#      open issues only, so closed issues are enumerable just by scanning docs/issues/*.md)
#   e  every backticked in-repo pointer in config/context-map.md's index resolves (test -e)
# Classes a (supersession half) and b are pure filesystem and always run. The issue-link
# checks query the tracker seam and run only when `tracker.sh mode get` succeeds; absent a
# declared mode they are skipped silently, so the lint works in a bare repo with no backend.
# Remote backends match issue titles only (tracker.sh list does not expose bodies); local
# matches title and body. This script only DETECTS - the archive/close action is BATCH-class
# per loop-auto, and closing an issue additionally requires an evidence receipt (done verb).
# Output: one "LINT <class> <path-or-issue>: <why>" line per finding; exit 0 clean, 1 on any.
