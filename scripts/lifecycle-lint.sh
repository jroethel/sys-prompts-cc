# lifecycle-lint - deterministic lifecycle reconciliation detector (no hooks, no daemons; run
# on demand, before declaring work done (conventions.md rule 6), and at handoff time). Classes:
#   a  superseded+unlinked plan-set: a live docs/plans/*-plan{,_loop}.md whose date is older
#      than the newest live plan-set, not archived, and referenced by no OPEN issue
#   b  orphaned brief: a live docs/briefs/*-brief.md whose plan already sits in docs/archive/
#   c  an OPEN issue still referencing an ARCHIVED plan stem (completed work, open ticket);
#      backlog `idea` issues are exempt - parked ideas cite archived stems by design
#   d  a CLOSED issue referenced by a LIVE plan (local backend only: tracker.sh list exposes
#      open issues only, so closed issues are enumerable just by scanning docs/issues/*.md)
#   e  every backticked in-repo pointer in config/context-map.md's index resolves (test -e)
#   f  filename grammar: a lane doc dated on/after filename-grammar-since: whose name does not
#      match <date>.<tokens>.<slug>.md
#   g  roadmap R-tag defect: a duplicate or malformed [R...] tag in ROADMAP.md (absence is
#      never flagged)
#   h  consumed-unarchived handoff: every action in ## Next actions carries a disposition but
#      the file still sits in docs/handoffs/; gated by lifecycle-lint-since:
# Class f runs only when filename-grammar-since: exists in config/repo-state.md; class g runs
# whenever ROADMAP.md exists. Classes a (supersession half) and b are pure filesystem and
# always run. The issue-link checks query the tracker seam and run only when `tracker.sh mode
# get` succeeds; absent a
# declared mode they are skipped silently, so the lint works in a bare repo with no backend.
# Remote backends match issue titles only (tracker.sh list does not expose bodies); local
# matches title and body. This script only DETECTS - the archive/close action is BATCH-class
# per loop-auto, and closing an issue additionally requires an evidence receipt (done verb).
# Output: one "LINT <class> <path-or-issue>: <why>" line per finding; exit 0 clean, 1 on any.
