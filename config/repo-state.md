# Repo State Map

This file is the machine surface: the line-anchored keys and the Lanes table that parsers read.
The tracker backend (github, gitlab, or local) is declared in the `tracker:` key below.
Mode-invariant doctrine lives in the sibling `config/conventions.md`.

template-version: 7

rubix-autorun values: ask (offer the optional Rubix review once) | off (skip silently) | on (run without asking); absent means ask.

## Lanes

| Lane          | Home                           | How                                            |
| ---           | ---                            | ---                                            |
| Roadmap       | `ROADMAP.md`                   | Living file; edit in place, no mirror.         |
| Issues        | GitHub (open, no `idea`)       | `ISSUES.md` via `scripts/gen-mirrors.sh .`.    |
| Backlog       | GitHub (label `idea`)          | `BACKLOG.md` via `scripts/gen-mirrors.sh .`.   |
| Wayfinder     | GitHub (label `wayfinder:map`) | `WAYFINDER.md` via `scripts/gen-mirrors.sh .`. |
| Handoffs      | `docs/handoffs/`               | Per session; git fallback in conventions.md.   |
| Chain state   | `docs/chain-state.md`          | Runtime, gitignored.                           |
| Batch reviews | `docs/reviews/`                | Per review run.                                |
| Archive       | `docs/archive/`                | Moved work lands here.                         |
| Sessions      | `docs/sessions/`               | One card per session; see conventions.md.      |

Every session opens a session card before its first substantive action: scripts/session-card.sh open (doctrine: conventions.md, Session records).

Backlog cross-repo view: `gh search issues --owner jroethel --label idea --state open`.
Per-repo fallback when private-repo search is unavailable: `gh issue list --label idea --state open`.

GitHub is the single source of truth.
Mirrors are read-only snapshots whose headers disclose staleness.
They regenerate at handoff time or on demand - no hooks, no daemons.
